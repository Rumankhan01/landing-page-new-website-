                    up 2.05%, and electricity and gas 1.36%. The majority of
                    industry is made up of textile units, with textiles contributing
                    $15.4b to exports,making up 56% of total exports. Other units
                    include surgical instruments, chemicals, and a budding automotive industry

                    a jaffa. Zak Crawley had no answer to the seamer that
                    darted in from around the off stump and took his sticks
                    with it. On a track which has nothing for the fast bowlers,
                    that sort of a delivery was required to ensure Pakistan picked
                    wickets.Not to forget, the wicket was of Crawley who had smashed
                    a ton already in the Test match.
